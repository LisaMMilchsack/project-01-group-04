I thought it might be useful to share our notes to different papers. If we all have the same knowledge, it will be easier to discuss things. 

##Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11412

-	Methods used were genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays,
  microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays 
-	The analysis revealed 4 major breast cancer classes, which are different in gene expression
-	In therapy 3 major classes are distinguished: ER+ Patients, which receive endocrine therapy, 
  HER2 amplification patients (we had strategies treatment strategies in lecture) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients,
  often BRCA1 is mutated, patients can only be treated with chemotherapy
-	The new step of this paper is to include the methods mentioned above. Earlier studies just used data from mRNA expression,
  DNA copies and parallel sequencing (no idea what the last thing is)
-	Total number of patients is 825
-	A LOT  of different mutations were found during whole exome sequencing, which lead to following new genes associated with breast cancer:
  TBX3, RUNX1, CBFB, AFF2, PIK3R1, PTPN22, PTPRD, NF1, SF3B1 and CCND3.
-	Genes confirmed and already known to be important for breast cancer development were:
  PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, TP53, GATA3, CDH1, RB1, MLL3, MAP3K1 and CDKN1B.
-	mRNA-expression of cancer subtypes revealed different mutation patterns in different subclasses ( needs a more detailed description)
-	Patterns vary also by mutation type (nonsense, misssense etc.)
-	Further analysis showed a strong connection to the germ line of ~10% of breast cancers, including BRCA1 mutations,
  confirming the TNBC subclass (not the best description I ever made ðŸ˜Š) 
-	It gets more and more detailed and I donâ€™t know how useful it is to continue making notes.
  I think in further analysis for our project this paper will be helpful.
